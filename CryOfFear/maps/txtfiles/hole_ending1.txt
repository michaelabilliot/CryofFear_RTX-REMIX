#Conclusion

Well, now I finally understand. I've been wandering the whole night

wondering why I was being chased by monsters,

but now that thing has reminded me. I remember committing suicide.

I'm dead.

Oh, and do you know where I am now? Hell!

I am doomed to be endlessly running scared. Forever!

This is my torture, my eternal punishment.

And there is nothing and nobody that's going to change this.

It's all over.

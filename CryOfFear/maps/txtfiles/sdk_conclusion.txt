#Conclusion

"Hello! This is Andreas Rönnberg speaking, I'd 

just like to go through a couple of things to this SDK.

We are not allowing anyone to use content from Cry of Fear

in their own mods. We only allow people to use the CoF

content to Cry of Fear itself, to for example mappacks

and such. Hence why we haven't released the source code.



Also if you want your maps and stuff to be integrated

into Cry of Fear (so everyone who is playing Cry of Fear

can play it from the main menu), you must not edit any

Cry of Fear files, only add new files. For example if

you want to edit a monster, copy the monster and edit

the copied monster, not the original monster.



When you are done with your campaign or mappack, PM

ruMpel or James on the forums so we can discuss about

your stuff. If you have edited any Cry of Fear files, we

will not approve your mod and not integrate it into

Cry of Fear. However if everything is fine and we do

integrate your campaign, you will of course have your

name or team name next to your custom campaign.



We will help you as much as we can to get your

mappack/campaign into the mod. Just register on our forums

and ask us questions if you are stuck on anything. Visit

the forums at www.cry-of-fear.com/forum. We do support you!



But keep in mind that this is not anything you can use

to your own mods, still, only for Cry of Fear.



Thank you, and happy modding!"

#Conclusion


"What the fuck is going on here? What is happening... To me?

When I woke up, I thought I was dead... But, I was in my room, with my computer turned off.

Mom and Dad aren't home, they must have went out. But... Something is not right here.

Who the heck is that guy with the chainsaw, and why is he... trying to kill me?

I just have to keep going... until I find someone who can help. I hope I'm not going insane...

This is shit, just... shit."

#Conclusion

Last night I had a nightmare, and it felt so real.

I thought it was never going to end.

I was wandering through the streets

and there were monsters everywhere trying to kill me.

Sophie committed suicide and I felt like I was about to.

Obviously my situation makes that impossible. I can't walk.

However, I did learn something from it. The book isn't working.

I know Doctor Purnell believed it would help me,

but writing down my feelings only seems to make them worse.

What really makes me feel better is the confidence my mom has in me.

I also feel happier when Sophie comes to visit.

There is still a long way to go, but I feel hope,

something I haven't had in a long time.

I am confident I will heal both my legs and my mind.

This is the last entry in my book.

The End.

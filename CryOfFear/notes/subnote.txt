My life.
That fateful night, the child lay upon the road, broken.
"Why did you have to walk that way so late, young man?
Why did you have to be so foolish?" Disillusioned and

And so he lived what remained of his life. One day fate
smiled upon the child, and so he came upon the implement
of his destruction, decisions! Decisions! The outcome was

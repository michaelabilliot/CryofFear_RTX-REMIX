Personal note
Jeff, Welcome to the team!
I'm sure your supervisor has already gone over the basics,
but here's a few things you'll want to know!
1) This cave is wet, cold and filled with puddles. Watch your step!
2) Cigarette breaks every 2 hours (most important!)
3) The supervisor is a dick
4) Remember the code to Section D.
You're going to be going back and forth all day, so you'll need to memorise it.
The code is 279 (the last number is covered in ink. I can't read it)

#Conclusion


Finally... It's all over. By the time you are

reading this, you will find my dead body covered

in blood with my head blown to bits.

I know, you might think I'm not... or wasn't normal.

I was crippled, stuck in a wheelchair, and that's

why I had to die. I was broken, defect, full of emotional

problems. My mind was stuck in a never ending loop of

anxiety, depression and despair. A rollercoaster with

no end, and I wanted out so bad.

This book writing tip was fucking bullshit, it only

made me realize how truly fucked my life was. Ironic

how that one person who was actually paid to help me

only made it worse; gave me that one last push that

was needed for me to end myself, and now

he is dead. Heh, it's almost poetic.



The only person who tried to help me was my only

friend, Sophie. Please tell her I'm sorry, I wish her

all the best. Please don't show her this mess.



This is my conclusion, this is my end, farewell everyone.

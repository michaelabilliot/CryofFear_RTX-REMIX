#Conclusion


"Dear diary." This is it. I have ended my miserable life.

I couldn't take this shit any more. Being trapped

in a wheelchair for the rest of my damn life is

just not worth it. The surgeons told me that everything

would be ok, they gave me hope, only to 

crush it under the soles of their feet

and watch me destroy myself. They lied to me!

They didn't know what it felt like! I thought

I could handle my emotions, control them,

contain them, prove them all wrong, but I was

just too weak. I let it slip through my

fingers, out of my grip. It poisoned me, it

clouded my mind. They didn't know anything, they

only feel the cold touch of their knives!



They gave me antidepressants. It helped

me think clearly, to see things through.

I took a couple of extra pills this afternoon,

they showed me what I had to do in this... short

moment of clarity. They showed me that there was

noone and nothing worth living for. They showed me 

how fake Sophie and my doctor were, how they were

laughing at me behind their masks when I wasn't looking.

Laughing at me, my legs, thinking that

they are so good, that they are better than me.

Pretending that they care about me, it's all bullshit! 



The pills showed me the truth today, they always did.

They opened my eyes, they gave me wisdom, and I acted upon it.

So I had to kill Sophie and my doctor..., my... 

"mentor", my "counsellor". Heh. I had to take

them down with me. They're not laughing any more!

Oh I wish I could've taken everybody with me, but

unfortunately, my situation makes that impossible. 



To whoever is reading this: I hope my dead body will

haunt you forever. Have fun scraping my brains off

the wall. 



Fuck you.

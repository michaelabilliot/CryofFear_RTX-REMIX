#Conclusion


Waging battle against the dreadful demons of Simon's

book was without a doubt one of the most horrifying

experiences we've ever encountered. But somehow, we survived it

by working together.

We managed to stop Simon by cutting off the chain of events that

would've led to a sorrowful destiny.

#Conclusion


I stopped myself from doing it, from committing 

suicide. But it didn't only leave me alive, it also

left two police officers dead. I killed them, shot

them both. This was not supposed to happen.

Doctors testified that I was having a

psychosis, which means that my punishment won't

be too hard for me to bear.



I have to spend the rest of my life in a

mental hospital, where nurses and doctors are taking

care of me. They let me finish my book, and it has helped me

a lot. I wrote a happy ending, just for myself. I feel

better now, I am more at peace with myself, even

though I'm still stuck in this wheelchair, but I accept

that now. I can never forgive myself for shooting those

two officers though, but I have so many supportive

people around me now, so I think I will be ok.

Doctor Purnell is mentoring me and is

watching my progress. I am lucky to have him.



Sophie visits me every once in a while, when the

doctors let her that is. They still think her visits

are too "destabilizing" for me and that it hinders my

progress. I keep on telling her how sorry I am for

making her life miserable every time she's here. She then

just laughs a bit and tells me to stop being so silly, but

I can see the damage I've done to her in her eyes every time

she looks at me. She found a new friend, one who is

there for her and treats her right. I'm happy for

her, though I'll miss the good moments we've had, knowing

that they'll never come back.



I think this is a good time to close this book.

It has changed my life forever. 



The end.
